                        <p>Side C Album Club, in the simplest terms, is like a book club—but for albums, artists, and discographies. We spend meetings discussing various aspects of the music that stuck out to us and appreciate the differing thoughts and opinions that stem from it. This organization allows those who are passionate about music to congregate and create a community bound together by this culturally and personally unique component of everyone's life. We listen to music both inside and outside of the club, host listening parties, hold musicology seminars, and host plenty of other exciting events, socials, and fundraisers. Our club is all-inclusive and open to anyone regardless of their musical knowledge. Side C is also a safe space where people can share their non-judgmental views on the music we critique. 

                            Every two weeks, we have discussions about two albums chosen by members. Meetings last about an hour and a half long and are currently held on every other Thursday from 7:10PM to 8:30PM right here on Discord! Albums from all genres of music are welcomed.</p>
